# Setup

1. Clone repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyrus01337/react-hamburger-menu-experiment.git
```

2. Install dependencies using your favourite package manager (this repo uses PNPM)
3. Run dev script using your favourite package manager (`pnpm dev` in my case)
4. Visit `localhost:3000`
5. Interact with hamburger menu - you should expect a side-panel moving into view as the rest of the site dims, becoming a background to the new content
